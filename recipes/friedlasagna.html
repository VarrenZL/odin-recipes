        <h3>When Larry Made Lasagna</h3>
        <p>
            When Larry made lasagna<br>
            all his neighbors stopped and stared.<br>
            His lasagna was the largest<br>
            that had ever been prepared.<br>
            <br>
            He used ninety yards of pasta<br>
            and a half a ton of cheese,<br>
            and the sauce, he spread with spatulas<br>
            that looked a lot like skis.<br>
            <br>
            With a hundred pounds of vegetables<br>
            and wagon-loads of meat<br>
            plus a tiny sprig of parsley<br>
            his lasagna was complete.<br>
            <br>
            So he lifted that lasagna<br>
            with a forklift and a crane<br>
            and he placed it in an oven<br>
            that was longer than a train.<br>
            <br>
            For a week, while it was baking,<br>
            its aroma filled the town,<br>
            till he took it from the oven<br>
            piping hot and golden brown.<br>
            <br>
            All the neighbors came and tasted it<br>
            but frowned at him, and then<br>
            they complained, “It needs a bit more salt.<br>
            You’ll have to start again.”<br>

        <h2>Let's get to making some lasagna!</h2>
        <h3 id="ingredients"><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups crushed crackers (or bread crumbs)</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ tsp chili flakes</li>
            <li>8 lasagna sheets, boiled to al dente according to package instructions and separated so they don't stick together</li>
            <li>4 Mozzarella cheese strings</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>1/2
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Steps:</b></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Crush the crackers using a rolling pin or food processor, and mix with the parmesan cheese and chili flakes. Place in a large bowl or a deep plate</li>
            <li>Boil the lasagna sheets if you haven't already</li>
            <li>Cut each mozzarella stick into half along the length, and then half again along the width. This will give you 4 little sticks from each stick, and the length of each stick will be almost the same as the width of a lasagna sheet. If you're using fresh mozzarella, cut into a similar stick shape</li>
            <li>Place a lasagna sheet onto a clean surface, and cut into half so you have 2 shorter sheets (1 lasagna sheet will make 2 rolls)</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the spinach alfredo sauce on each half evenly</li>
            <li>Place a mozzarella cheese stick on one end of the sheet, and then roll it up tightly into a little log</li>
            <li>Repeat until all sheets are used up (you should have a total of 16 rolls)</li>
            <li>Place the rolls in the freezer for 15-20 minutes until they firm up</li>
            <li>In the meanwhile, break 2 eggs in a large bowl and whisk until they are properly broken down</li>
            <li>Once the rolls have firmed up, remove from the freezer. Working one roll at a time, dip into the egg, and then into the coating. Make sure to get the coating all over, especially on the two ends of each roll so they cheese cannot leak out. Place the rolls on a wire rack</li>
            <li>Heat 2" of vegetable oil in a wide-bottomed pan until it reaches 350F. Start by frying 1 test roll. Gently place it in the oil, and constantly stir and turn it gently as you cook for 5-6 minutes until the roll is golden and crispy all over. Let it cool down and taste it to ensure it is cooked to your liking</li>
            <li>Then fry the remaining rolls in 2-3 batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan</li>
            <li>Serve the rolls while still hot with some marinara sauce on the side.</li>
        </ol>
